Abstract—With continued ocean and atmospheric warming,
sea levels will likely rise for many centuries at higher rates than
that of the current century. The change in global sea levels is
linked to two primary factors: thermal expansion caused by
warming of the ocean and melting of glaciers. It is needless to
state that as a consequence of a significant sea level rise, deadly
and destructive phenomena will result. Using tide stations and
satellite laser altimeters the current overall local and global sea
level changes are monitored. But these tools aren’t designed to
predict a possible future scenario of sea level rise. The purpose
of this project is to predict the most optimized future global sea
level rise using advanced machine learning models. Total 22
years’ worth of sea level rise data has been utilized to train our
models using various sorts of machine learning algorithms e.g.
Lasso Regression, Moving Average, Dense Neural Network,
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN based on WaveNet).
Among these algorithms, CNN (WaveNet) gave the most
optimized result with the least mean absolute error.
